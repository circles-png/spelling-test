# spelling test

an (overengineered?) spelling test full stack application using

- **tailwindcss**
- **react**
- **vite**
- **typescript**
- **rust**
- **rocket**
- **docker**

mainly for learning this stuff and for fun
includes an api backend and a react frontend

it is kinda funny

## running

use the `build.sh` script to build a docker compose image
then `docker compose up` it

hosts on localhost port `80`
